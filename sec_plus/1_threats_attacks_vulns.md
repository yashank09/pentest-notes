## Terms

- Malware - bad functions on device/network
- Virus - unwanted prog that can reproduce
- Crypto Mal - same as Ransom??
- Ransomware - access denied till money paid - wannacry :sad:
- Worm - self contained, self spreading malware thru mails, networks etc.
- Trojan - sneaky mofos
- Rootkit - kernel access, cannot detect by most 'surface' softwares
- RAT - Remote Access Trojan - indian scammers
- Backdoor - pwnd

## Types

### Phishing

- Spear - specific targets
- Whaling - bigger whales like CTOs
- Vishing - voicing
- Tailgate - pass thru
- Impersonation - become someone else
- Dumpster - trash - legal in most states unless on private property
- Shoulder - see thru
- Hoax - fake shit
- Watering hole - go where the animals go
- Social Engineering - dont share too much online
  - Authority - 'I WANT access to the identity else FBI will be mad'
  - Impersonation - 'calling from the nearest Walmart. Need info for the coupon you filled'
  - Consensus - 'Its obviously okay to share your password with the IT guy'
  - Scarsity - 'Dude if you dont let me in, the server goes down and John will be MAD'
  - Familiarity - 'Hi Karen! My embarassing toilet is chocked. Could I go for a quick peepee?' Checks out modem model etc.
  - Trust - 'You see me gardening since last 2 weeks. I forgot my keys today, let me in bro'
  - Urgency - same as scarsity? Maybe not as scarcity is limitation of resources, while urgency is limitation of time

### App Attacks

- DoS - most loved but basic af
- DDoS - bit badass but not good enough for giants - can be made better by mixing other attacks
- MitM - sitting between network and devices, sniffing everything - requires mix of attacks like DNS poisioning etc.
- Buffer Overflow - OOF programmers!
- Injection - what you weren't expecting to get
- XSS - allow external code on webapps
- Cross-site request forgery XFRF - unauth commands by little auth user
- Privilage Escalation - gain access when not given
- ARP Poisioning - act like a device and router by faking IP-to-MAC on TCP/IP
- Amplification - take smaller chunks and multiply to bigger packets
- DNS Poisioning - use DNS flaws to divert traffic from a know server to a pwnd one
- Domain Hijacking - get rights to the user domain - used to destroy Wannacry :( worked against us
- Man-in-Browser - MitM but on the browser than the network
- Zero Day - happning right now...We all shall know when we discover
- Replay - keep stuff looping so the system never finishes, thereby DoSing themselves
- Hijacking - ;) 
  - Clickjack - click me but i'm not an 'add to card'
  - Session Jacking - use cookies/session to become some other user
  - URL Jacking - misspell the url like githyb.com
- Driver Manipulation
  - Shimming - inject code into the system without changing the actual code itself
  - Refactoring - rewrite internal code without chaging any bhavior
- MAC Spoofing - I'm a Windows Dell but ill say I'm an apple watch
- IP Spoofing - act like another site that the system thinks as okay

### Wireless Attacks

- Replay - PASSIVE attack - capture wireless data, record, send back maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed
- Initialization Vector - random gen code used to encrypt, usually with another key(s)
- Evil Twin - Act like another network using same SSID (Service Set Identifier) as a proper AP
- Rogue AP - unauth/unconfigured AP that lets you connect
- Jamming - disable with noise/waves
- WPS - connect with a button - anyone allowed for that time
- Bluejacking - sending unauth data to bluetooth
- Bluesnarfing - gaining access to unauth bluetooth
- RFID
- NFC
- Disassociation - kick clients out

### Crypto Attacks

- Birthday - find collisions in the hashing algo - based on idea that in a room of 30/50 people, atleast 2 will share the same birthday 50% times?
- Known pain/cypher text - retrieve both plain/cypher text with hashed key
- Rainbow Tables - large set of encrypted passwords
- Dictionary - commonly used plaintext
- Collision - pretty much loke birthday
- Downgrade - kindda like driver manipulation, but downgrading system version to exploit pre-fixed code
- Weak Implementation - config/library choices that mess up system - human related
